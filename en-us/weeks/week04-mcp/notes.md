- [ ] 🧪 LangChain agent querying LlamaIndex index via MCP
- [ ] 📊 Measure latency and protocol overhead
- [ ] 📝 Analysis: when MCP is worth it vs direct integration

**Expected outcome:** Practical demonstration of interoperability

---

### **Day 7: Final Mini-Project**
**Time:** 60-90 min  
**Objective:** Distributed system with multiple services communicating via MCP

**Activities:**
- [ ] 👨‍💻 Create `mini_mcp_ecosystem_project/`
- [ ] 🏗️ Architecture: 3 services (RAG, Analysis, Summarization) + Orchestrator
- [ ] 🔗 Each service exposes capabilities via MCP
- [ ] 🧪 Orchestrator uses MCP to coordinate services
- [ ] 💻 Web interface to demonstrate complete flow
- [ ] 📊 Dashboard showing real-time MCP communication
